ClinicalBERT in Google Colab

This repository provides a guide and code snippets for running ClinicalBERT, a pre-trained language model specifically designed for clinical text, in Google Colab. ClinicalBERT can be used for various clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and relation extraction.

    Install the required libraries: Run the following code cell to install the necessary libraries.
  
    Import the required libraries: Import the necessary libraries in your code cells to work with ClinicalBERT.

Usage

  To use ClinicalBERT in your Google Colab notebook, follow these steps:
  
    Import ClinicalBERT: Load the pre-trained ClinicalBERT model and tokenizer.
  
    Process and tokenize your text: Preprocess your clinical text and tokenize it using the tokenizer.
  
    Perform inference: Move the input tensors to the GPU if available and perform inference with ClinicalBERT.
  
    Interpret the results: Extract the predicted class label and probabilities from the model's output.
  
  Feel free to customize the code snippets based on your specific use case and requirements.
